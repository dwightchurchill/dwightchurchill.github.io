title: Keep Brad Marchand on the Ice

Brad Marchand is no stranger to controversy (many wanted him suspended for a late game punch in the second round of playoffs) but the 71st overall pick in the 2006 NHL draft has proven to be one of the best over the last ~10 seasons. This season Marchand has put together another insane one with 100 points in the regular season and 18 in the playoffs prior to the upcoming Finals. He is the first Bruin to hit 100 points in the regular season since Joe Thornton did in the '02–03 season and is the only Bruin that is averaging more than 1 point per game in the playoffs. To keep things entertaining, he also finished the regular season with just under 100 penalty minutes.

Nonetheless, once Marchand clears ~1300 minutes of ice time (there were only three seasons where he played less than that, including the shortened 2012–2013 lockout season) and 25 goals in a season, the Bruins win.

Over the Halifax native's career 262 regular season goals (visualized above over each arena's location) and 28 playoff goals he has consistently pushed the Bruins to be a better team. Now with the Stanley Cup Finals around the corner, he has the chance do it again. In fact, the Boston Bruins hold a playoff record of 27–1, when Brad Marchand scores. That is a ridiculous statistic when you consider that the last time they lost a game in the playoffs, where Marchand scored, was 7 years ago.

To summarize, while there are many variables I can't control for, there is a clear hypothesis that when Marchand scores, the Bruins win, espcially in the playoffs. The upcoming Finals will be an almost 50 year flashback to 1970, the last year the St. Louis Blues attended. Bobby Orr's infamous photo (below) was taken then and the Bruins swept the Blues in four games. We'll see if they can pull off another one!
