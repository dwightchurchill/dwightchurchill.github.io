title: Keep Brad Marchand on the Ice

Brad Marchand is a controversial player but the 71st overall pick in the 2006 NHL draft has proven to be one of the best. This season, Brad Marchand has put together another insane one with 100 points in the regular season and 18 going into the Cup Finals. He is the first Bruin to hit 100 points in the regular season since Joe Thornton did in the '02–03 season and is the only Bruin that is averaging more than 1 point per game in the playoffs. To keep things entertaining, he also finished the regular season with just under 100 penalty minutes.

Nonetheless, it is clear that once Marchand clears ~1300 minutes of ice time in a season (there were only three seasons where he played less than that, including the shortened 2012–2013 lockout season), his goals are north of 24 per season and the Bruins win.

Over the Halifax native's career 262 regular season goals (visualized below over each arena's location) and 28 playoff goals he has consistently pushed the Bruins and while the 2019 Cup Finals are just about to kick off, he has the chance do it again.
In fact, the Boston Bruins hold a playoff record of 27–1, when Brad Marchand scores. That is a ridiculous statistic when you consider that the last time they lost a game, where Marchand scored, was 7 years ago.
The upcoming Finals will be a flashback to 1970, the last year the St. Louis Blues attended. Bobby Orr's infamous photo (below) was taken then when the Bruins swept the Blues in four games.
